# Technical Integration Implementation Tasks

## Overview

Implementation tasks for integrating technology stack components with the Electron architecture foundation. This document reflects the **actual components** used in the application.

**Reference Plans**: `core/01-electron-architecture.md`, `ai_hub_tech_stack.md`
**Status**: âœ… Core Architecture Complete

## Phase 1: Core Architecture Integration (Completed)

### Task 1.1: Filesystem-Based Data Persistence

- [x] Implement file-based storage for Personas, Memory, and Plugins using `fs-extra`.
- [x] Create loader classes (`MemoryLoader`, `PluginLoader`) to read data from JSON files on startup.
- [x] Integrate loaders with manager services (`PersonaManager`, `MemoryManager`, etc.).
- [x] Ensure data is saved back to the filesystem on changes.
- [x] Use `PlatformUtils` to manage OS-specific data directory paths.
- [x] Test and validate data persistence across application restarts.

### Task 1.2: IPC-Based Communication Layer

- [x] Use Electron's IPC as the sole communication channel between main and renderer processes.
- [x] Expose all main process functionality via a secure `contextBridge` API in `preload.ts`.
- [x] Create a wrapper for IPC handlers (`/ipc/wrapper.ts`) to manage security, logging, and rate-limiting.
- [x] Define clear, typed channels for each domain (system, persona, plugin, etc.).
- [x] Implement robust error handling for all IPC communication.

### Task 1.3: Renderer State Management

- [x] Use standard React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useCallback`) for local component state.
- [x] Fetch data from the main process via the exposed `electronAPI` on component mount.
- [x] Implement basic loading and error states in UI components.
- [ ] Evaluate need for a more advanced state management library (e.g., Zustand, TanStack Query) as complexity grows.

## Phase 2: UI & Frontend Integration (Partially Complete)

### Task 2.1: UI Component Framework

- [x] Create foundational React components for core features (`SystemHealthDashboard`, `PersonaListItem`).
- [x] Use a combination of inline styles and a global `index.css` for styling.
- [ ] Establish a consistent UI component library (e.g., using TailwindCSS or a dedicated library like Shadcn UI).
- [ ] Refactor inline styles to a more maintainable system.

### Task 2.2: Theming and Responsiveness

- [ ] Implement a theming system (e.g., light/dark mode).
- [ ] Ensure all UI components are fully responsive and accessible.
- [ ] Create a consistent design language and apply it across the application.

## Phase 3: AI & Processing Integration (Not Started)

### Task 3.1: AI Engine Integration Framework

- [ ] Design an abstraction layer for integrating local/remote AI engines (e.g., Ollama, Llama.cpp).
- [ ] Define IPC channels for AI-related tasks (e.g., text generation, embeddings).
- [ ] Implement resource management for local AI models.

### Task 3.2: AI-Database Bridge

- [ ] Plan and implement vector storage for semantic search (e.g., in SQLite with an extension).
- [ ] Create an embedding and retrieval pipeline for memories.
- [ ] Design and build AI-powered memory organization features.

## Tech Stack Implementation Checklist (Actual)

### Data Layer

- [x] **File System**: `fs-extra` and `fs/promises` for storing JSON data.
- [x] **Data Loaders**: Custom loader classes for each data type.
- [ ] **Database**: Evaluate migration to a local-first database like `SQLite` or `LiveStore`.

### API & Services Layer

- [x] **Electron IPC**: Secure communication between main and renderer.
- [x] **Service Managers**: Classes to manage business logic for each domain.
- [x] **Zod**: Schema validation for data integrity.

### State Management

- [x] **React Hooks**: For local component state.
- [ ] **Advanced State Library**: To be evaluated.

### AI Integration

- [ ] **AI Engine Abstraction**: To be designed.
- [ ] **Local/Remote Engine Support**: To be implemented.

### UI Framework

- [x] **React**: Core UI library.
- [ ] **Component Library**: To be selected and implemented.
- [ ] **Styling**: To be refactored (e.g., to TailwindCSS).

## Dependencies & Integration Points

### Internal Dependencies

- Electron architecture foundation (Week 4 completion)
- Security framework integration
- Performance optimization compatibility

### External Dependencies

- Database libraries (LiveStore, better-sqlite3)
- AI engine binaries (Ollama, LLaMA.cpp)
- UI libraries (MUI, liquid-glass-react)
- API framework (Express/Fastify)

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All tech stack components properly integrated
- [ ] Database operations work offline-first
- [ ] AI engines communicate via IPC without issues
- [ ] API server handles all required endpoints
- [ ] State management works seamlessly across processes
- [ ] UI framework renders consistently across platforms
- [ ] Performance targets maintained with full integration

## Implementation Notes

- Follow progressive enhancement - start with minimal integration
- Test each integration point thoroughly before moving to next
- Maintain compatibility with security and performance requirements
- Document all integration patterns for future reference
- Create fallback mechanisms for each external dependency
- Focus on maintainable and testable integration code

**Status**: Not Started
**Timeline**: 8 weeks (parallel with security/performance)
**Dependencies**: Electron architecture foundation
