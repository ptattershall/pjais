# Responsive Design & Accessibility Implementation Plan

## Overview

This plan ensures PajamasWeb AI Hub provides an inclusive, accessible, and responsive user experience across all devices and user capabilities. The implementation focuses on WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, mobile-first responsive design, and comprehensive accessibility features.

### Integration Points

- **UI Foundation**: Responsive breakpoints and accessibility features
- **Component Library**: Accessible component patterns and responsive behaviors
- **Theme System**: High contrast modes and accessible color schemes
- **Performance**: Optimized for assistive technologies and various devices

### User Stories

- As a mobile user, I want the interface to work seamlessly on small screens
- As a screen reader user, I want proper navigation and content structure
- As a keyboard user, I want full functionality without a mouse
- As a user with visual impairments, I want high contrast and scalable content

## Architecture

### 1.1 Responsive Design System

```typescript
// Responsive breakpoint system aligned with Material-UI
interface ResponsiveBreakpoints {
  xs: 0;      // 0-599px (mobile phones)
  sm: 600;    // 600-959px (small tablets)
  md: 960;    // 960-1279px (tablets)
  lg: 1280;   // 1280-1919px (small laptops)
  xl: 1920;   // 1920px+ (desktops)
}

interface ResponsiveConfiguration {
  breakpoints: ResponsiveBreakpoints;
  
  // Grid system
  grid: {
    columns: 12;
    spacing: {
      xs: 8;
      sm: 16;
      md: 24;
      lg: 32;
      xl: 40;
    };
  };
  
  // Typography scaling
  typography: {
    htmlFontSize: 16;
    scaleFactor: {
      xs: 0.875;  // 14px base
      sm: 0.9375; // 15px base  
      md: 1;      // 16px base
      lg: 1.0625; // 17px base
      xl: 1.125;  // 18px base
    };
  };
  
  // Touch targets
  touchTargets: {
    minSize: 44; // iOS/Android minimum
    spacing: 8;  // Between interactive elements
  };
}
```

### 1.2 Accessibility Framework

```typescript
interface AccessibilityConfiguration {
  // ARIA support
  aria: {
    labelRequiredFields: boolean;
    announcePageChanges: boolean;
    announceFormErrors: boolean;
    announceDataUpdates: boolean;
  };
  
  // Keyboard navigation
  keyboard: {
    trapFocusInModals: boolean;
    highlightFocusedElements: boolean;
    skipToContentLinks: boolean;
    keyboardShortcuts: KeyboardShortcut[];
  };
  
  // Screen reader support
  screenReader: {
    announceRegions: boolean;
    announceHeadings: boolean;
    describeImages: boolean;
    announceFormValidation: boolean;
  };
  
  // Visual accessibility
  visual: {
    highContrastMode: boolean;
    reducedMotion: boolean;
    largeText: boolean;
    colorBlindSupport: boolean;
  };
}

interface KeyboardShortcut {
  keys: string[];
  description: string;
  action: () => void;
  scope: 'global' | 'page' | 'component';
}
```

## Implementation Details

### 2.1 Mobile-First Responsive Design

Mobile-first approach with progressive enhancement:

- **Mobile (xs)**: Single column, touch-optimized, simplified navigation
- **Tablet (sm/md)**: Multi-column grids, drawer navigation, touch + mouse
- **Desktop (lg/xl)**: Full feature set, keyboard shortcuts, complex layouts

**Responsive Navigation Strategy**:

- Mobile: Bottom tabs + hamburger menu
- Tablet: Collapsible sidebar
- Desktop: Persistent sidebar navigation

### 2.2 Touch and Gesture Support

**Touch-Friendly Design**:

- Minimum 44px touch targets for all interactive elements
- Adequate spacing between interactive elements (8px minimum)
- Visual feedback for touch interactions
- Long press for context menus
- Swipe gestures for common actions

**Gesture Implementation**:

- Swipe left/right for memory item actions
- Pull-to-refresh for data lists
- Pinch-to-zoom for memory graphs
- Long press for additional options

### 2.3 Accessibility Implementation

**Keyboard Navigation**:

- Logical tab order throughout the application
- Visible focus indicators with high contrast
- Keyboard shortcuts for common actions
- Focus management in modals and dynamic content

**Screen Reader Support**:

- Semantic HTML structure with proper headings
- ARIA labels and descriptions for complex interactions
- Live regions for dynamic content announcements
- Alternative text for images and visualizations

**Visual Accessibility**:

- High contrast mode support
- Reduced motion preferences
- Scalable text up to 200% zoom
- Color-blind friendly color schemes

### 2.4 High Contrast and Visual Accessibility

**High Contrast Mode**:

- Automatic detection of system preferences
