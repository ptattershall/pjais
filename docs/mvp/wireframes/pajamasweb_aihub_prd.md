### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Memory System

#### Hybrid Memory Model

| Layer                           | Purpose                                              |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Vector DB (pgvector)            | Fast semantic recall (fuzzy memory)                  |
| Relational DB (Postgres/SQLite) | Explicit structured memory (entities, events, tasks) |
| Linkage between layers          | Vector entries linked to relational facts/events     |

**Data Lifecycle:**

- New facts: stored in relational + embedded into vector
- Stale data: summarized, compressed
- Very old: archived to disk
- All controlled by Memory Optimizer Agent

#### Relational Schema Example

**Entities:** | id | type | name | tags | last\_seen | importance\_rating |

**Events:** | id | entity\_id | type | timestamp | details\_json | embedding\_id |

**Tasks:** | id | assigned\_to | status | timestamps | result\_summary |

**Relations:** | id | from\_entity | to\_entity | relation\_type | created\_at |
